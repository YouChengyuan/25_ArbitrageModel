# 25_ArbitrageModel
We collected the daily K-line data of over 5,000 stocks from early 2019 to  the end of 2024, extracted the qualified fluctuating upward intervals, and attempted to explore the factors  influencing the duration of these intervals. Based on this, we aim to design an arbitrage model.
